<h2 id="C2" align="center">Freedom Project</h2>
<p> The freedom project is a project where we get to choose a topic we would like to further study and use our coding skills and character skills throughout it. We have spent time working on it in class and at home. Throughout the first semester we have used the skills we learned in class to create the freedom project. Some character skills we used are collaboration, agency. My freedom project revolves around the medical field. It is focused on what is a cure, what is a treatment,the benefits and disadvantages of both.

<h2 id="C5" align="center">Extra Info / Tips</h2>
<ul><li><p>People often confuse the terms treatment and cures and their meanings which can often lead to false hope.</p></li>

<li><p>Patients and their family members to do thorough research about the illness and the treatments that are available and if there are any cures. </p></li>

<li><p>Families who have someone that is ill or in need of medical attention should always look for the big picture of how everything that is being used usually affects other patients and the smaller details of how their illness and the treatment or cure that is being received affects the patient individually. </p></li>

<li><p> Both treatments and cures have their benefits and negative impacts</p></li>

<li><p>The impacts depend on the type of illness and the type of treatment or cure that is being used.</p></li></ul>

<h2 id="C4" align="center">What Is A Treatment?</h2>
<p>They are two terms when referred to finding a solution or  resolution to a problem in the medical field. A  treatment is one of them, a resolution to an illness or disease, helps in controlling the illness until there is a cure available. Unlike a cure, the treatments do not make the patient's problems disappear. A treatment focuses more on controlling the illness as well as pain, the person will still have the illness throughout the treatments. Some treatments if followed thoroughly can lead to having the illness removed completely but it is not very likely. Not all treatments are the same; there are a variety of treatments that a person can go through depending on what illness or struggle they are dealing with. Most people believe treatments will take away their illness but in reality a treatment is only a temporary solution. It usually is just used to keep the patient's illness stable from becoming too much for that person to handle.
