<h2 id="C2" align="center">Freedom Project</h2>
<p> The freedom project is a project where we get to choose a topic we would like to further study and use our coding skills and character skills throughout it. We have spent time working on it in class and at home. Throughout the first semester we have used the skills we learned in class to create the freedom project. Some character skills we used are collaboration, agency. My freedom project revolves around the medical field. It is focused on what is a cure, what is a treatment,the benefits and disadvantages of both.

<ul><li><p>People often confuse the terms treatment and cures and their meanings which can often lead to false hope.</p></li>

<li><p>Patients and their family members to do thorough research about the illness and the treatments that are available and if there are any cures. </p></li>

<li><p>Families who have someone that is ill or in need of medical attention should always look for the big picture of how everything that is being used usually affects other patients and the smaller details of how their illness and the treatment or cure that is being received affects the patient individually. </p></li>

<li><p> Both treatments and cures have their benefits and negative impacts</p></li>

<li><p>The impacts depend on the type of illness and the type of treatment or cure that is being used.</p></li></ul>

<h2 id="C4" align="center">What Is A Cure?</h2>
<p>They are two terms when referred to finding a solution or  resolution to a problem in the medical field. A cure is one of them, the patient will no longer have that particular condition, it will be removed completely. Usually cures take longer to find than treatments and the process to look for a more cure is more rigorous. Cures are used to make an illness or disease disappear entirely so the patient will no longer be affected by it or suffer any longer. Unfortunately, there are no cures for every illness in the world. If there is not a cure for a certain illness usually there are multiple treatments trying to fight the disease or illness.
